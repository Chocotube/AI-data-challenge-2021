# AI-data-challenge-2021

## Data challenge background

Pulmonary ultrasound may be an alternative tool to screen patients with or suspected of having COVID-19. A prospective study carried out at the AP-HP evaluated the correlation between a pulmonary ultrasound severity score and the unfavorable clinical evolution of the patient under 28 days.

In this data challenge, you will need to use a machine Learning approach on data from this study to construct a global predictor of the patient's clinical outcome.
